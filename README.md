# Viagogo Tech Test

### What is it?

A small ruby program that given an X and Y co-ordinate, returns the 5 nearest venues, their prices and distance.

### The challenge

* My program should randomly generate seed data.
* My program should operate in a world that ranges from -10 to +10 (Y axis), and -10 to +10 (X axis).
* My program should assume that each co-ordinate can hold a maximum of one event.
* Each event has a unique numeric identifier (e.g. 1, 2, 3).
* Each event has zero or more tickets.
* Each ticket has a non-zero price, expressed in US Dollars.
* The distance between two points should be computed as the Manhattan distance.

### My Approach

Looking at the above requirements I decided I needed a ticket, event, calculator and an interface class.
